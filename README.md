# customer_segmentation
## Description
Client companies have various parameters, such as: number of employees, types of activities, region in which they are located, etc.
At the same time, there is a hypothesis that, depending on these parameters, clients may be satisfied or dissatisfied with different levels of non-permits in their company.
For example: "Mosgortrans" is a large government organization. There is an assumption that just based on its size and affiliation with the government, everyone there remains satisfied even with a high level of non-admission (for example, 40-50%).

And there is, for example, “DL-TRANS” - a private company with an expensive transportation service and not so many drivers. Therefore, they are unhappy with even a low level of non-admissions (every driver, every flight is very important for this type of company).

In this project, I had to find out on what parameters companies depend on their satisfaction with their level of non-admissions.

Solving this problem would allow:

1. More effectively retain customers: By knowing in advance which customers may be prone to leaving due to dissatisfaction, you can take measures to retain them, for example, by offering them special programs or conditions, or lowering the level of exclusion in their favor (for example, by using more loyal attitude of doctors to video recording, or through the active expansion of individual health boundaries for drivers)
2. Develop marketing strategies effectively: Predicting satisfaction levels can help develop more targeted marketing strategies. For example, for companies with a high potential for dissatisfaction, special offers or promotions can be developed to improve their satisfaction.
