# customer_segmentation
## Description
Client companies have various parameters, such as: number of employees, types of activities, region in which they are located, etc.
At the same time, there is a hypothesis that, depending on these parameters, clients may be satisfied or dissatisfied with different levels of non-permits in their company.
For example: "Mosgortrans" is a large government organization. There is an assumption that just based on its size and affiliation with the government, everyone there remains satisfied even with a high level of non-admission (for example, 40-50%).

And there is, for example, “DL-TRANS” - a private company with an expensive transportation service and not so many drivers. Therefore, they are unhappy with even a low level of non-admissions (every driver, every flight is very important for this type of company).

In this project, I had to find out on what parameters companies depend on their satisfaction with their level of non-admissions.
